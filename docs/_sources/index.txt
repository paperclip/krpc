kRPC Documentation
==================

kRPC allows you to control Kerbal Space Program from external scripts running
outside of the game. It comes with client libraries for :doc:`Python
<python/client>` and :doc:`Lua <lua/client>`.

kRPC is programming language and runtime agnostic. This means you can interact
with it from any programming language that can communicate over a TCP
connection, and you can run your program using any compiler/interpreter/virtual
machine you like.
