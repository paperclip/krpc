AutoPilot
=========

.. class:: AutoPilot

   Provides basic auto-piloting utilities for a vessel.
   Created by calling :attr:`Vessel.auto_pilot`.

   .. method:: engage()

      Engage the auto-pilot.


   .. method:: disengage()

      Disengage the auto-pilot.


   .. method:: wait()

      Blocks until the vessel is pointing in the target direction (if set) and has the target roll (if set).


   .. attribute:: error

      The error, in degrees, between the direction the ship has been asked
      to point in and the direction it is pointing in. Returns zero if the auto-pilot
      has not been engaged, SAS is not enabled, SAS is in stability assist mode,
      or no target direction is set.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: roll_error

      The error, in degrees, between the roll the ship has been asked to be
      in and the actual roll. Returns zero if the auto-pilot has not been engaged
      or no target roll is set.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: reference_frame

      The reference frame for the target direction (:attr:`AutoPilot.target_direction`).

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: :class:`ReferenceFrame`


   .. attribute:: target_direction

      The target direction. ``nil`` if no target direction is set.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: tuple of (number, number, number)


   .. method:: target_pitch_and_heading(pitch, heading)

      Set (:attr:`AutoPilot.target_direction`) from a pitch and heading angle.

      :param number pitch: Target pitch angle, in degrees between -90째 and +90째.

      :param number heading: Target heading angle, in degrees between 0째 and 360째.


   .. attribute:: target_roll

      The target roll, in degrees. ``NaN`` if no target roll is set.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: sas

      The state of SAS.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: boolean

      .. note::

         Equivalent to :attr:`Control.sas`


   .. attribute:: sas_mode

      The current :class:`SASMode`.
      These modes are equivalent to the mode buttons to
      the left of the navball that appear when SAS is enabled.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: :class:`SASMode`

      .. note::

         Equivalent to :attr:`Control.sas_mode`


   .. attribute:: rotation_speed_multiplier

      Target rotation speed multiplier. Defaults to 1.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: max_rotation_speed

      Maximum target rotation speed. Defaults to 1.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: roll_speed_multiplier

      Target roll speed multiplier. Defaults to 1.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: max_roll_speed

      Maximum target roll speed. Defaults to 1.

      :Property: Can be read or written

      :rtype: number


   .. method:: set_pid_parameters([kp = 1], [ki = 0], [kd = 0])

      Sets the gains for the rotation rate PID controller.

      :param number kp: Proportional gain.

      :param number ki: Integral gain.

      :param number kd: Derivative gain.
