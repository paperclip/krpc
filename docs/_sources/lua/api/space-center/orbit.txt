Orbit
=====

.. class:: Orbit

   Describes an orbit. For example, the orbit of a vessel, obtained by calling
   :attr:`Vessel.orbit`, or a celestial body, obtained by calling
   :attr:`CelestialBody.orbit`.

   .. attribute:: body

      The celestial body (e.g. planet or moon) around which the object is orbiting.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: :class:`CelestialBody`


   .. attribute:: apoapsis

      Gets the apoapsis of the orbit, in meters, from the center of mass of the body being orbited.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number

      .. note::

         For the apoapsis altitude reported on the in-game map view, use :attr:`Orbit.apoapsis_altitude`.


   .. attribute:: periapsis

      The periapsis of the orbit, in meters, from the center of mass of the body being orbited.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number

      .. note::

         For the periapsis altitude reported on the in-game map view, use :attr:`Orbit.periapsis_altitude`.


   .. attribute:: apoapsis_altitude

      The apoapsis of the orbit, in meters, above the sea level of the body being orbited.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number

      .. note::

         This is equal to :attr:`Orbit.apoapsis` minus the equatorial radius of the body.


   .. attribute:: periapsis_altitude

      The periapsis of the orbit, in meters, above the sea level of the body being orbited.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number

      .. note::

         This is equal to :attr:`Orbit.periapsis` minus the equatorial radius of the body.


   .. attribute:: semi_major_axis

      The semi-major axis of the orbit, in meters.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: semi_minor_axis

      The semi-minor axis of the orbit, in meters.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: radius

      The current radius of the orbit, in meters. This is the distance between the center
      of mass of the object in orbit, and the center of mass of the body around which it is orbiting.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number

      .. note::

         This value will change over time if the orbit is elliptical.


   .. attribute:: speed

      The current orbital speed of the object in meters per second.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number

      .. note::

         This value will change over time if the orbit is elliptical.


   .. attribute:: period

      The orbital period, in seconds.

      :Property: Read-only, cannot be set

      :rtype: number


   .. attribute:: time_to_apoapsis
