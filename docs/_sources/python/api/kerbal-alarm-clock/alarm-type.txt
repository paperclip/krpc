   .. data:: apoapsis

      An alarm for furthest part of the orbit from the planet.

   .. data:: periapsis

      An alarm for nearest part of the orbit from the planet.

   .. data:: ascending_node

      Ascending node for the targeted object, or equatorial ascending node.

   .. data:: descending_node

      Descending node for the targeted object, or equatorial descending node.

   .. data:: closest

      An alarm based on the closest approach of this vessel to the targeted
      vessel, some number of orbits into the future.

   .. data:: contract

      An alarm based on the expiry or deadline of contracts in career modes.

   .. data:: soi_change_auto

      See :attr:`AlarmType.soi_change`.

   .. data:: transfer

      An alarm based on Interplanetary Transfer Phase Angles, i.e. when should
